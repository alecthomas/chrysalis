Okay, there are only really 3 interfaces....video, keyboard and mouse.
May need a joystick one later.....

Video Interface
===============
A) INITIALISATION
Ideally, need to be able to set up a window of any size (X,Y). The window
needs to be directly memory mapped. That is, the initialisation function
returns a pointer to a linear array of X*Y dimensions. Hmmm, don't know if 
I've explained that coherently....I'll do it another way :)

char *videoBuffer = winGraphicsInit( width, height );
#define putPixel( x, y, colour ) videoBuffer[ y * width + x ] = colour

There, I think that ought to do it :)

B) PALETTE
Needs to conform (in some manner) to the following:
   setPaletteIndex( int index, int r, int g, int b );

Where index is a value between 0 and 255...and r,g,b are.....whatever Windows
takes.

From what I know of Windows (gleened from reading some of the WinG stuff) you 
can't have a "simulated" indexed colour scheme under 32768/65536/16M colour
modes....would that mean we'd have to force the user into 256 colour mode?

A way of getting the palette values for a certain index would also be 
helpful. Although, again, not imperative.

C) OTHER STUFF
A vertical retrace check would be useful.

And that's about it :)

Mouse Interface
===============
Need to be able return the X,Y position, and status of the buttons on the
mouse. Also, setting the mouse position would be nice, but not imperative.

KEYBOARD INTERFACE
==================
Okey dokey, for the keyboard routines what's needed is the following:

An char array[ 128 ]; of boolean on/off values for each key. With each of the
values in the following list mapping to an index in the list:

Also, whenever a key is pressed, a char variable needs to be set, showing the
index of the key. Same thing with a key release, different variable 
obviously :).
