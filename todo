# This is where all the interesting stuff starts
- make circle/line routines for the editor....DONE! :)
- maybe, make each object have a pointer to an event???
  it's either that, or make each event have a list of objects
  /me dunno which is a better idea
- i don't think i'll have each object point to events....for one thing,
  that would mean i couldn't have one object linked to two events...bad!
- in the editor, the user needs to be able to create object lists, vectors,
  type in number(s), etc.....this will be fun (not!)
